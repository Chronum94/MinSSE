# MinSSE (pronounced min-ess-ess-ee or min-see, whichever you prefer): A minimal 2/3D Heisenberg lattice simulator using the stochastic series expansion method

Minimal compilation:

`clang++ sse_driver.cpp --std=c++17 -Ofast -DNDEBUG -DRANDOM_GENERATOR` where
`RANDOM_GENERATOR` can be `XORSHIFT128`, `XORSHIFT32` (don't really recommend this...), `SQUARES`, `AES4`, or `LCG`. You can also replace `clang++` with `g++` and it should compile.

Not-so-minimal compilation:

`clang++ sse_driver.cpp --std=c++17 -Ofast -march=native -mtune=native -g -fno-unroll-loops -malign-double -DNDEBUG -DRANDOM_GENERATOR`

The general run signature is:

`./a.out nx ny nz beta dilution nbins msteps isteps int32_seed`

`nx`, `ny`, `nz`: Lattice sizes along each direction. Periodic boundaries are implemented in all directions. If `nz=1`, you have a 2D lattice.\
`beta`: Inverse temperature.\
`dilution`: Percentage of vacancies in lattice.\
`nbins`: Number of bins in which to bin the run data.\
`msteps`: Number of Monte-Carlo sweeps per bin. A measurement is done after each sweep.\
`isteps`: Number of equilibriation sweeps. This is to bring the number of operators to an equilibriated number.\
`int32_seed`: An int32 number, which SmallPRNG reads in, mixes a bit, and use _that_ as a seed. It's still all deterministic.

Minimal run with (assuming you're currently in the directory with the `a.out` executable):

```
mkdir TestDir
cd TestDir
../a.out 4 6 1 2.0 0.0 100 1000 900 234545234
```

The above line runs a `4x6x1` lattice at inverse temperature (beta) of `2.0`, `0.0` dilution fraction, gathering `100` bins of data, each of `1000` Monte Carlo sweeps. `9000` equilibriation sweeps are carried out prior to taking measurements. The seed used in the initial mixing of the PRNG is `234545234`. Note that this is **not** the seed that your runtime PRNG will use, but is instead a seed that will be given to a smaller PRNG to generate a random integer, which has more state, that is then given to your runtime PRNG.

The above run will output a few files:

`spinmask.out`: A 'mask' of the spins. 1 corresponds to occupied, 0 to a vacancy.\
`spinbonds.out`: The number of bonds on a spin.\
`bonds.out`: Bonds and the index of the spins it connects.\
`out.log`: Some basic calculation details.\
`locsusc.dat`: The local susceptibility for each spin in the lattice. Each row is a bin.\
`results.dat`: The uniform susceptibility and total energy of the lattice for each bin.
